    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>These are the projects I have worked on so far during my Epicodus class. I didn't want to put anything here, but
      I'm <strong>required</strong> to use certain HTML tags, and there wasn't anywhere else for them to go. Here is a
      list of reasons I don't like JavaScript:
    <ol>
      <li>There is a type of variable specifically designed to <em>never</em> be variable.</li>
      <li>It has nothing to do with Java, only a desire to ride its coattails, making things confusing for everyone.
      </li>
      <li>I'm confused</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <img id="headshot" src="img/meredithbeach.jpg" alt="Meredith (me!) at the beach">
    <p>My name is Meredith Hansen, and I am a 26 year-old student living in Klamath Falls, Oregon. I have always been
      interested in technology, and started dabbling in programming in 2019. I am currently in a part-time intro class
      at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> to learn more about programming and web design. I'm hopeful
      that I can find a way to turn my interest into a career in technology! When I'm not learning programming, I enjoy
      reading, playing videogames, and hiking.</p>
